catsIntro: |
  <p>Street cats have always stirred in Toma an irresistible urge to feed them. For many years she has carried pouches of cat food in her bag. Then we arrived in Yerevan, a city with so many strays.</p>
  
  <p>At first, Toma fed the fluffballs only now and then. But one cat learned to call at our window every evening, loudly inviting us to serve dinnerâ€¦ The trap was set. Before we knew it, we were feeding her kittens â€” the ones she pointedly left in our care before walking off to enjoy her freedom.</p>
  
  <p>In return, we had her spayed. While arranging that, we met our neighbors and the cats theyâ€™d been looking after. Thatâ€™s how a small crew of friendly yardâ€‘buddies gathered around us.</p>
  
  <p>Everything was fine â€” until 2025, when new pregnant cats appeared, and suddenly we had a crowd of kittens. Wild roamers may drop by and move on, but we canâ€™t in good conscience abandon our tame, resident friends.</p>
  
  <p>Once, Fridtjof Nansen helped refugees find a new home and a future. Now we want to give a similar chance to the street cats from his street.</p>
  
  <p>Help us find homes for these friendly tails â€” or support our initiative financially.</p>
