catsTitle: "Cats of Nansen street"
catsIntro: "Help us improve the lives of the local cats. Since 2023 we have been treating, sterilizing and feeding the cats that wander into our yard. Our first followers have grown into happy adult companions, but new guests keep coming for help. There are more mouths to feed and sterilizations require funding. We want to find a home for all of them. With us they grow up kind and affectionate friends. We'd take them all but can't."
