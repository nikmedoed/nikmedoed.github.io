catsIntro: |
  <p>Street cats have always triggered Tomaâ€™s wild urge to feed them. For many years, she has always carried pouches of cat food in her bag. And then we came to Yerevan, where stray animals are everywhere.</p>

  <p>At first, Toma fed the fluffballs only occasionally. But soon one cat started systematically shouting at our window, loudly demanding dinnerâ€¦ And that was the trap. Now we were already feeding her kittens, which she demonstratively handed over to us before going off to enjoy her freedom.</p>

  <p>For that, we had her spayed. While organizing everything, we met neighbors and their own strays. This is how a little group of settled, friendly buddies formed around us.</p>

  <p>Everything was fine, but in 2025 new pregnant cats appeared â€” and now we have a crowd of kittens. If wild wanderers drop by, they donâ€™t stay. But we simply cannot abandon our tame little tails.</p>

  <p>Once, Nansen helped refugees gain the right to a home and a future. Now we want to give a similar chance to the street cats of his street.</p>

  <p>Help us find homes for these friendly companions â€” or support our initiative financially.</p>
