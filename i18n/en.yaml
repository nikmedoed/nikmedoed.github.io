catsIntro: |
  <p>
   That‚Äôs what we used to hear under our window in Yerevan ‚Äî a clever cat we
   nicknamed <a href="#cat-krichulka" class="cat-relative" data-target="cat-krichulka">Krichulka</a> came every night to call us for dinner.
   And then‚Ä¶ she brought her kittens and went off to enjoy her freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
   We had her spayed and started taking care of the little ones.
   But in 2025 two new pregnant cats appeared in our yard, and <a href="#cat-mamashka" class="cat-relative" data-target="cat-mamashka">Krichulka‚Äôs mom</a> kept escaping our attempts to catch her for sterilization.
  </p>

  <p>
   Now we have a whole crowd of fluffy friends. If we do nothing, 
   90% of them will die ‚Äî from disease, cold, hunger, or even stray dogs 
   attacking them right before our eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
   We could manage feeding and treating 4 cats. But now there are 15. 
   We can‚Äôt take them home ‚Äî our own cat is terminally ill. 
   Please help us spay, treat, and find families for these sweet, 
   hand-tamed fluffballs.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
