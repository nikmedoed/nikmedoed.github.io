# nikmedoed.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal landing page and portfolio.
The site is generated with **Hugo** using Bulma for styling and a small dark/vivid palette.

Visit the site here: <https://nikmedoed.github.io>

Main page features:

- Short introduction with a link to my CV
- Grid of highlighted open source projects
- Brief about section
- Contact links and donation options

Project cards have a placeholder `<div class="card-image">` to insert screenshots or short videos stored under `static/media/`.

The `experience` page summarises my work history and links back to the main page.

To build the site locally run `hugo` and open `public/index.html`.

Feel free to explore the code or get in touch if you have questions!
