# nikmedoed.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal landing page and portfolio. The site is a simple static page with custom CSS and a bold color palette from my "Resist, Invent & Projects" blog.

Visit the site here: <https://nikmedoed.github.io>

Main page features:

- Short introduction and link to my CV
- Grid of highlighted open source projects
- Quick about section
- Contact links and donation options

The separate `experience.html` page summarises my work history and links back to the main page.

Feel free to explore the code or get in touch if you have questions!
