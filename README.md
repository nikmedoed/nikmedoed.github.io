# nikmedoed.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal landing page and portfolio. The site is a simple static page built with [Bulma 1.0](https://bulma.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses a custom color palette from my "Resist, Invent & Projects" blog.

Visit the site here: <https://nikmedoed.github.io>

Main page features:

- Short introduction and call to view my CV
- Highlights of selected open source projects
- Quick about section with link to the full experience page
- Contact links and donation options

The separate `experience.html` page contains a concise resume with the same styling.

Feel free to explore the code or get in touch if you have questions!
