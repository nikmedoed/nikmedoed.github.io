# nikmedoed.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal landing page and portfolio.
The site is a static page built with **Bulma 1.0** plus a small stylesheet with my
dark/vivid color palette.

Visit the site here: <https://nikmedoed.github.io>

Main page features:

- Short introduction with a link to my CV
- Grid of highlighted open source projects
- Brief about section
- Contact links and donation options

Project cards have a placeholder `<div class="card-image">` where you can insert
screenshots or short videos. Add your media files under the `media/` directory
and reference them from these blocks.

The `experience.html` page summarises my work history and links back to the main page.

Feel free to explore the code or get in touch if you have questions!
